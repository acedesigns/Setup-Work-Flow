##My set up for Ubuntu 14.04##

This serves as a ducumentation oon how I was able to set up my Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS.
I was able to find that info using '`lsb_release -a`' via the terminal.

## Setting Up Your LAMMP Stack ##
- `sudo apt-get install apache2`
- `sudo apt-get install mysql-server libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql`
- `sudo mysql_install_db`
- `sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation`
- `sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt`
- `sudo service apache2 restart` and `sudo service mysqld restart`

## Setting Up Git ##
- `sudo apt-get install git` 
- `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
- `git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"`
- `[Set Up SSH Keys!](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/#platform-linux)`


## Server Communication ##
Lately I have learned that it is safer to communicate with the server using SSH over other convensional methods.
I think this method is slightly different from the SSH descibed above, becouse I was able to SSh into my **http://localhost**. I presume that I would do the same to a remote server.

- `sudo apt-get install openssh-server`

So next I wil try to SSH to a remote server and push my web project.
Documantation will be continued ...... But The idea is to Dev on my local machine, push to github, Connect to a remote server with SSH and then Pull from github. Thus illiminating the use of the FTP process.
